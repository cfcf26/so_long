# So Long Project

## Introduction

The So Long project is a basic 2D game where a dolphin escapes Earth after eating some fish. You can use any character, any collectible, and any place you want instead of a dolphin, fish, and the Earth.

## Mandatory Part

- Program name: so_long
- Turn in files: Makefile, *.h, *.c, maps, textures
- Makefile: NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
- Arguments: A map in format *.ber
- External functions: open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, all functions of the math library (-lm compiler option, man man 3 math), all functions of the MiniLibX, ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded
- Libft authorized: Yes

Your project must comply with the following rules:

- You must use the MiniLibX. Either the version available on the school machines or installing it using its sources.
- You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not relink.
- Your program has to take as a parameter a map description file ending with the .ber extension.

## Bonus Part

You will get extra points if you:

- Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
- Add some sprite animation.
- Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell.

You can add files/folders based on bonuses as needed.

The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is PERFECT. Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done and works without malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at all.
